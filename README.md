- Typography: Typography plays a crucial role in website design. By choosing appropriate fonts, font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing, it becomes possible to enhance readability and establish a visual hierarchy. Careful selection and placement of typography can greatly impact the overall user experience

- User-Centered Design: Keeping the user at the center of the design process is key. Considering user needs, behaviors, and expectations helps in creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Conducting user research, usability testing, and incorporating feedback throughout the design and development process can lead to better overall user experiences.

- Spacing and Margin Understanding the importance of spacing and margin is crucial for achieving a visually balanced design. Consistent and intentional spacing between elements improves readability and creates a clear visual hierarchy.
